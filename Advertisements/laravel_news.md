## Jsoniary Personal: Free Plan for Individual Laravel API Developers

We are two indie hackers launching our first SaaS app focused on API devs. We both consider this app to be our "coolest" project. Laravel community has always played an important part in my growth as a developer. I am feeling very excited and equally nervous to put this in front of you!

Jsoniary replaces Postman & Swagger from your development toolkit. We are focused on being super easy to test, document and collaborate on APIs. Here's what you get and what you can do:

- Desktop Client
- Test REST, SOAP, GraphQL & Neo4j requests
- Auto-generate your API's Documentation
- Host your API docs directly from Jsoniary
- Smart API Editor
- Web Application Access
- Live Auto-Sync (Desktop <-> Web App)
- Offline Mode

Get Jsoniary Personal, our **100% Free Plan** that's made for individual API developers. No Strings Attached.
