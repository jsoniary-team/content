**TL;DR: Jsoniary replaces Postman from your development toolkit. You can collaborate with your team on API Testing & Documentation at an affordable price.**

Jsoniary is focused on being super easy to test and document your APIs. You can test your API with our desktop app, click *Sync* and the documentation would be automatically generated using the test API's request and response. No more writing down lengthy documentation of request parameters, authorizations and responses. We do that for you!

We are launching a free private beta in early November for limited members and looking for Laravel/Lumen developers working on APIs frequently in their apps.
