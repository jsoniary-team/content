## Jsoniary Personal: Free Plan for Individual Laravel API Developers

Myself, and my partner, Sunil, are indie developers like the most of you! We have launched our first SaaS app together. Laravel community has always been an important part of my growth as a developer. We both consider this app to be our "coolest" project. A lot of our emotions and dreams are involved in this app. I am feeling very excited and equally nervous to put it in front of you!
