## Jsoniary - Test, Document & Collaborate on Your APIs

**TL;DR: Jsoniary replaces Postman from your development toolkit. We are looking for Laravel/Lumen based API developers for our free private beta access.**

Jsoniary is focused on being super easy to test and document APIs. You can test requests with our desktop app, click *Sync*, and the documentation would be automatically generated. No more writing down lengthy files for documenting request parameters, authorizations, and responses between your team. We do that for you!

We'll soon launch a free private beta for our app. If you develop APIs and are frustrated with documentation, Jsoniary can help you!
