**TL;DR: Jsoniary replaces Postman from your development toolkit. You can collaborate with your team on API Testing & Documentation at an affordable price.**

Jsoniary is focused on being super easy to test and document APIs. You can test your API with our desktop app, click *Sync*, and the documentation would be automatically generated. No more writing down lengthy files of request parameters, authorizations, and responses. We do that for you!

We are launching a free private beta in early November. If you are a Laravel/Lumen developer frequently working on APIs, do take a look at Jsoniary.
