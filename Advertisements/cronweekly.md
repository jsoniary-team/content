**A free, once-weekly API Newsletter**

We are two indie developers curating this free newsletter to keep you informed about all things API. Our focus is on developers who are regularly involved in building or integrating APIs. We bring you a list of free & paid APIs for fetching data, links for in-depth tutorials, tools, and jobs for API Developers.


**Jsoniary: Free Private Beta Access**

We're two indie developers launching our first product. I am feeling very excited and equally nervous to put it in front of you!

Jsoniary replaces Postman & Swagger from your API toolkit. It is focused on being super easy to test, document and collaborate on APIs. You get a Desktop Client supporting REST, SOAP & GraphQL requests, we auto-generate API Documentation for you, host your API's Docs, you can edit them in Jsoniary API Editor, and keep them auto-synced across your team.
